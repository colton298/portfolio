      <h2>Wordle Solver</h2>
      <p>
        I love playing Wordle with my friends and family, and have done so for my years.
        So, I created a Wordle solver using JavaScript and CSS. This can accurately solve
        any Wordle, using the words from the real game!

      <h2>COP4331 (Processes for Object Oriented Software Development) - Project Manager</h2>
      <p>In this course, I oversaw the completion of two projects.</p>

      <h3>Small Project - Jungle Contact Book</h3>
      <p>
        Our team developed a website that allows users to sign up, add contacts to a list
        with a variety of information, delete contacts, and edit them. I personally created
        the presentation for this project, setup the domain and initial website, developed
        meeting talking points, and created all the diagrams present in our presentation.
      </p>
      <h4>Presentation Slides</h4>
      <div className="slides-embed">
        <iframe
          src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQe-FPUfPq9du39R5POld1k7CDgKZ5SFg8W5DStlLoMts1FjHIUoVKhvgfBmtWToJZg402KCC6qkSOh/pubembed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"
          width="100%"
          height="300"
          style={{ border: "none" }}
          allowFullScreen
          title="Jungle Contact Book Slides"
        />
      </div>

      <h3>Large Project - Digital Wellness</h3>
      <p>In this larger project, we developed a website and app where users can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track their days by adding activities and timing them</li>
        <li>Rank themselves against other users with a leaderboard and point system</li>
        <li>Utilize email verification and a forgot password system for security</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once again, I created the presentation and associated diagrams, while also tracking
        team progress using a gantt chart and meeting talking points.
      </p>
      <h4>Presentation Slides</h4>
      <div className="slides-embed">
        <iframe
          src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRc2JH0IYydreVK3HXYpAHFeJZrLzo-68lQkv5ctTzlgc4mf8ot4S6wKLjNESam4EWK9ZxEhiFRu8Wy/pubembed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"

          allowFullScreen
          title="Digital Wellness Slides"
        />
      </div>

      <h2>This Website!</h2>
      <p>
        I coded this project from scratch, using React. Check out my code using the
        github link:
